<h1>about me</h1>
Hello! My name is Deborah Emedoro, a passionate and curious web development student<br /> with a strong interest in building beautiful and responsive websites. <br />I enjoy turning ideas into real digital experiences using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.<br />
I'm currently learning the basics of front-end development <br />and always exploring new ways to improve my skills. <br />My goal is to become a creative and confident web developer who can build websites<br /> that are not just functional, but also user-friendly and visually appealing.<br >
When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring design inspiration,<br /> learning new tech tricks, and challenging myself with new projects.
